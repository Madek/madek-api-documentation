## Usage 

### Build 

`bundle exec middleman build`. 

### Test 

1. `bundle exec middleman`  
2. `bundle exec rspec spec/`

The tests perform: 

* check for existence of internal links including fragments `#...`,  
* check for existence of external links (requires internet connection), and
* spell checking. This requires `hunspell` to be in the path and also the
    `en_US` dictionary to be available.
